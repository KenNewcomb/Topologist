Topologist
=======

Computer simulation has allowed scientists and engineers to model a wide variety of chemical and physical systems. A plethora of techniques exist, ranging from highly accurate, but computationally expensive quantum mechanical methods to cheap and approximate course-grained methods. Regardless of the technique/software used, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_(chemistry)" target="_blank">topology</a>
 of the physical system must be completely described. For geometrically complicated systems, this can be a tedious and error-prone task.  

Topologist makes this task a breeze. Your life is about to get a whole lot simpler.
